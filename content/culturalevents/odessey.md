"I did not have a big fist to punch them, so I picked up a pen and
wrote my punches instead."

Poetry has always been one of the loudest gateways for expression of
notions, feelings, thoughts and much more, the list of which is
boundless. If you believe that you have got what it takes, if you have
been swallowing words that wanted to come out, if you have always wanted
to give a punch to that subject, we have built this platform for you
alone. Sentience '19 provides you this platform where individuals recite
and enact their own piece of work, the poem. Come here and take your
chance to give that one big punch that you have always wanted to give.

Poetry slam is currently the best trend going on in the literature
world. Speaking is as good an art as is writing and Poetry Slam is just
the perfect mix of both of these arts.
