"For me, graffiti means making marks on surfaces using just about anything, be it markers, spray,paint, chalk, lipstick, varnish, ink. Or it can be the result of scratches and incisions. The aim is to maintain the energy created by disturbance or excitement in the street." Spray Painting is a magical artwork by your beautiful hands. But would the same magical aura be created if a right-handed person is asked to paint with their left hand and vice versa? Will your less dominating hand be able to make you dominate the entire event and let you win? Participants will be provided all the items required for the event. Come in and set a new bench mark in the art of a spray painting.
