Love controlling a race ,chewing up opponents,
let&#39;s get down and dirty.let&#39;s fight it out,
it&#39;s raw and animalistic with no one to rely on but yourself.
Let your brain unspool the tangles that build up.
Run ,pound it out on pavement, channel that energy
and show the world the strength of your adrenaline rush.

Race that fast......time becomes slower....

Get to the blocks, run your race, stay relaxed, if you run your race, you will win.
