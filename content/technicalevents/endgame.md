gauntlet broken into 4 pieces- a total of 10 components required to rebuild the infinity gauntlet and
restore life in half of the universe. However, Thanos is smart and has hidden 15 fake components along
with 10 real components. The Avengers are struggling to keep Thanos encaptivated and have assigned you
the task collect the components.
There are 25 rooms each with a component. The rooms are arranged in a 5x5 grid and has a number

## Rules and Scoring

The event is automated. The size of rooms and the grid will be provided 2 weeks prior to competition. The
participants must program their robot in general to plan their path across the grid accordingly.
The participants will be given a set of 10 riddles. They must solve it and then input the answer to these
riddles to the program, so it can then use the algorithm to plan the path.

Therefore, the contestants must program the robot in general and give the input on site.

1. For each real component, you will get +3 points. And for each wrong component, you will get -1 points.
2. The goal is to collect as many components as you can as soon as possible. Components collected, the time spent and the path travelled shall be evaluated for all those who go inside the castle.
3. The robot can move only to adjacent cells and not diagonally.
4. If a robot crosses 1/3 rd of the room ,it must collect the component.
5. The robot must leave the grid, after collecting coins from the exit point.
6. Time shall be noted from starting point to exit point.

Time, the shortest path taken by the robot and the maximum collection of components will be taken under
consideration. **Time allotted is 4 minutes at most.**

1. Real component: +3 points.
2. Fake component: -1 points
3. If someone completes the event before time, here is how points shall be given:

|                   |                          |

| 30 seconds before | +2 points shall be given |
| 45 seconds before | +3 points shall be given |
| 60 seconds before | +4 points shall be given |
