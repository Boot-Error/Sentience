Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Nancy, Jonathan and other friends are trapped in The Upside Down. You
are Eleven. The only one powerful enough to rescue them. Bring them back home but only one at
a time. Avoid demogorgans, take your friends safely to the portal back home.
All the characters trapped are represented by different coloured balls. Every character has its
own importance and so does the ball. The balls are classified in 3 colours each having different
points and count all trapped in different locations in the upside down.
RED – 4 balls
GREEN- 6 balls
BLUE- 12 balls

In order to get your friends back home, the robot must push the balls into the basket,
representing portals. However, there are demogorgans in your way, the obstacles. You must
avoid them. At a time 2 robots will play, both trying to collect 1 ball at a time and reach the portal.
The robot able to score maximum points at end of game will be declared the winner. If you are lucky you might
get some surprise in the obstacles and the Arena, sounds interesting right?
