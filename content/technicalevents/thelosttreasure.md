## Game Description

You have this magical island with magical treasure. The chance for you to become
the ‘King of Seven Seas’ is just few moments away as the treasure would
disappear after seven minutes of you stepping on to the island. You need to start 
your hunt with first collecting silver coins (10 points each) to reach the Silver
stage (at least 3 silver in your boat) and then gold coins (20 points each) to reach
the Gold stage (at least 2 gold). But keep in mind that you can go for Gold stage
only if you have once passed the Silver stage. Once you have passed the Silver
stage and the Gold stage, then the KOHINOOR diamond becomes accessible. But
after capturing KOHINOOR diamond you need to capture a gold coin as well
within the next span of 5 sec to 15 sec, otherwise it will vanish from your boat and
will appear at its initial position again. Another gem in the treasure is the HOPE
DIAMOND which carries no point and is accessible throughout the hunt. In case of
equal score points at the end of the hunt, the pirate with HOPE DIAMOND will be
considered the ‘King of Seven Seas’. Besides this, you have the chance to steal the
treasure of other pirate by moving the paddle(A rotatory rod pivoted at boat’s
edge) of his boat but not going into the boat. At last the pirate with most points
will be declared as ‘KING OF SEVEN SEAS’

## Important points

+ You need to cross the Silver stage just once. If after collecting at least 3 silver coins, you went for gold coins and in meantime, opponent removed your silver coins, you need not to collect them again to go for Gold Stage. Stage once passed will be marked as PASSED.
+ Above point goes for Gold Stage as well. KOHINOOR doesn’t require the presence of at least 3 silver and 2 gold coins in your boat. But you must have crossed Silver stage and Gold Stage at some point of time to get KOHINOOR.
+ Opponent can’t enter your boat and vice-versa is also applicable.
+ If you accidently paddle out treasure from your boat, then that treasure will be considered out of your boat and you will not get any scores for that.
+ Hope diamond has no points.
+ Along with this there is Hope diamond which carries no point but in case of a tie, the Hope diamond will serve as tie breaker. The pirate with Hope diamond will be considered winner. In case, if hope diamond is not with any of the pirates and the scores are equal, then the priority order for the consideration of winner will be: 

	1. Pirate with KOHINOOR 
	2. Pirate with more gold coins.

+ The points of the coin or diamond will be given only if it is completely inside the boundary of the boat. In any case of dispute, the decision of coordinators will be entertained.


## How to score points

+ Collecting silver points will give you 10 points.
+ Collecting gold coins will give you 20 points. (But you can start collecting them only after you have crossed the Silver stage)
+ After passing Silver stage and Gold stage, you can go for the hunt of Kohinoor diamond (blue colored diamond). To capture Kohinoor diamond, there are certain rules-
+ As soon as you put Kohinoor diamond in your boat, a hope time starts. You need to stay still for first 5 seconds of Hopetime i.e., You cannot put any other coin for first 5 seconds in your boat after you put Kohinoor diamond in your boat, however you can defend your boat from the opponent in the meantime. Then from 6 th second to 15 th second you have to put a gold coin inside your boat, then only the Kohinoor diamond will be considered as captured by you. In any other case, the Kohinoor diamond will return back to its initial position in island.
+ Once Kohinoor is successfully inside your boat, the only way Kohinoor can come out is by using paddle.
+ You can also score points by paddling out coins of the opponent. You will be given points only if the coin(s) you paddled out is a gold coin or KOHINOOR 10 points will be rewarded on doing so. In case of Kohinoor, 20 points will be given. Silver coin and Hope diamond carries no point.

## Fouls

If any of the pirates collects coins without following the order mentioned
below:

1. Silver Stage
2. Gold Stage
3. Kohinoor diamond

+ You get a foul in case you enter the boat of the opponent. Keep in mind, you can just rotate the paddle of the opponent to bring the treasure out.
+ If you collect any coin and put it into your boat during the first 5 seconds of Hope time.

**Note: Any of the above mentioned situations (if fulfilled) will result in the
