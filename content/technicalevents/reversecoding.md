Think you know everything about programming? Well there are many ways to go, let's see which one you pick. This event looks for the real star that stands up to the ability of creativity and logic. So, be ready to storm out not just by switching systems but switching your brains into the all new arena.

**Problem Statement:** The difference between general competitive
programming competition and reverse coding is that you will not be given
the exact question statement but you will be provided with some set of
sample inputs and outputs which will be sufficient enough to guess the
problem and then you have to submit a code for your guessed problem.

## Event Criteria

**Team size:** 1-3

## Rule

-   Your team will be required to guess the problem with help of given input and output set and write program to solve the problems, which will then have to be submitted to an online judge.
-   Your programs can be written in one of either C, C++ or Java language.
-   There will be a runtime limit for each problem. Your solution should pass all the hidden test data within that time limit to receive the accepted verdict.
-   The winner will be declared on the basis of number of questions solved. If number of questions solved is same, the winner will be the team who solves the problems in least amount of time.
-   There will be a time penalty for each wrong submission to the online judge, but not for compilation error.
-   Team will have no access to cell phones.
-   Taking help of any kind will result in immediate disqualification.
